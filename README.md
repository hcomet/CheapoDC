# Introducing CheapoDC

The Cheapo Dew Controller, or CheapoDC, is a low cost, easy to build DIY dew controller based on an ESP32-C3 mini.
Parts required include the ESP32-C3 mini, a MOSFET module for each output, a 12V to 5V buck converter, some protoboard,
 RCA sockets, a 12V barrel socket and wire. Cost of the parts should be less than $20 for a unit that
controls 2 dew heater straps.

A primary goal was to keep the project cheap, simple and easy with:

* minimal low cost off the shelf components
* no coding or Arduino IDE experience necessary with both [Webflash](https://hcomet.github.io/CheapoDC/CheapoDCFlash.html) and [HTTP OTA Update](https://hcomet.github.io/CheapoDC/CheapoDCWebUpdate.html) support
* Comprehensive [Web UI](#web-ui) for configuration and management
* [INDI](https://www.indilib.org/) and [Stellarmate](https://stellarmate.com/) support 'out-of-the-box'

CheapoDC leverages the ESP32 WiFi
capability to query one of the open weather service APIs. Either the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API
or the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API may be used to retrieve ambient temperature, humidity and dew point
for the controller's geographic location. This is then used to calculate CheapoDC's power output. No additional
components, such as temperature or humidity probes, are required. The responsiveness and aggressiveness of the
controller can be adjusted through several configuration settings. CheapoDC works best with internet connectivity to
support the weather service queries but it can also be used in a limited way without internet access.

The CheapoDC may be set up using a basic configuration with two dew strap outputs or it may be configured with up to
four additional outputs. Each CheapoDC Output is controlled by a separate MOSFET module tied to one of the ESP32's
GPIO pins. The four additional outputs may be configured to be managed either automatically using the CheapoDC dew 
control algorithm, along with the two main dew controller outputs,
or manually via the Web UI or API. Dew control algorithm managed pins and thus dew strap outputs are all tied to the
same ESP32 PWM channel and will have the same output.

CheapoDC hardware build details can be found in the [Hardware](#hardware) section of this document. 

CheapoDC firmware may installed on your device using one of the following methods:

* Using the Arduino IDE: Details on how to build the CheapoDC firmware as well as information about the latest
firmware release may be found with the source code in the [CheapoDC/README.md](./CheapoDC#webflash-as-an-option).
* WebFlash: A web based utility that allows for the installation of the latest firmware directly to your ESP32-C3 based device.

CheapoDC also supports web based Over-the-air (OTA) upgrades of the firmware using the CheapoDC Web UI.

# How the Dew Control Algorithm Works

When working in Automated mode, the controller will periodically calculate the power output to the dew straps using the
calculations below. The default output calculation or update period is 1 minute.

## Controller Power Output Calculation

### Variables

* **Set Point** = ***SP***
  * as set using the **Set Point Mode** selection.
* **Reference Temperature** = ***RT***
  * as set using the **Temperature Mode** selection.
* **Track Point** = ***TP***
  * the calculated temperature point where the **Tracking Range** starts. A **Reference Temperature** less than or equal
to the **Track Point** will cause the controller to use **Maximum Output**.
* **Track Point Offset** = ***TPO***
  * a temperature offset applied to the **Set Point** when calculating the **Track Point** relative to the **Set Point**.
The **Track Point Offset** may be set from -5.0&deg;C to 5.0&deg;C. The default is 0.0&deg;C.
* **Tracking Range** = ***TR***
  * the temperature range starting at the **Track Point** where the controller output ramps up from **Minimum Output** at the high end of the range to **Maximum Output** at the low end of the range. The range may be set to values from 4.0&deg;C to 10.0&deg;C. The default is 4.0&deg;C.
* **Power Output** = ***PO***
  * the percentage of power the controller is outputting to the dew straps. It varies from the **Minimum Output** setting to the **Maximum Output** setting.
* **Minimum Output** = ***MinO***
  * the minimum percent power setting for the controller to output when not in the **Off** **Controller Mode**. Defaults to 0%.
* **Maximum Output** = ***MaxO***
  * the maximum percent power setting for the controller to output when at full output. Defaults to 100%.

### Calculations

$`TP = SP + TPO`$

$`IF`$ $`(RT <= TP )`$ $`THEN`$ $`PO= MaxO`$

$`IF`$ $`(RT >= (TP + TR))`$ $`THEN`$ $`PO = MinO`$

$`IF`$ $`(RT <(TP + TR))`$ $`THEN`$ $`PO = MinO + (MaxO - MinO) * ( 1 - ((RT - TP)/TR))`$

### Examples

Example 1 is primarily a reference image to illustrate the variables defined above.

* Power Output curve is shown relative to the Track Point and the Tracking Range. While the Reference Temperature is greater than the high end of the Tracking Range the Power Output is set to Minimum Output. The Power Output ramps up linearly through the Tracking Range from the Minimum Output to the Maximum Output as the Reference Temperature drops.
* This example shows a Reference Temperature, RT = 8°C, which is greater than the upper end of the Tracking Range, causing Power Output to be set to Minimum Output. In this case Minimum Output is set to 10%.
* The upper end of the Tracking Range, at 7°C, is determined from the Set Point (SP = -2°C) plus the Track Point Offset (TPO = 4°C), creating a Tack Point, TP = 2°C, plus the Tracking Range (TR = 5°C).  

   **NOTE:** The Set Point and the Reference Temperature values may vary from one output calculation to the next with each weather update.

![Example 1](images/example1.jpg)

Example 2 shows changing the values of the controller configuration variables can affect the Power Output calculation.

* The Set Point, SP = -2°C, and the Reference Temperature, RT = 8°C, the same as in Example 1. However changing the Track Point Offset, now TPO = 2°C, and the Tracking Range, now TR = 10°C, has changed the Power Output as well as flattening the Power Output curve.
* The Maximum Output has been increased, MaxO = 100%, to allow full power output to be reached at 0&deg;C.

![Example 2](images/example2.jpg)

## Dew Controller Configuration Settings

The following modes of operation are used by CheapoDC to determine overall controller operation as well as which values to assign to the Set Point and Reference Temperature when calculating output.

### Controller Mode

The Controller Mode selects the overall operating mode of the dew controller.

#### Automatic

* Uses the **Set Point Mode** and **Temperature Mode** settings to calculate the controller output based on the Power Output calculations above. In Automatic mode the Power Output calculation will be run periodically based on the Update Output Every setting. This may be set to a value from 1 to 20 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Automatic mode may be used with or without internet access.

#### Manual

* Controller output is manually controlled by setting the **Dew Controller Output** either through the Web UI or the API. When in Manual mode the the periodic Power Output calculation is suspended. Using Manual control is an option if internet access for OpenWeather API queries is not available.

#### Off

* Controller output is set to Zero.

### Set Point Mode

The Set Point Mode selects what will be used as the SetPoint for calculating Power Output.

#### Dew Point

* Uses the **Dew Point** as the Set Point used for calculating output. This is the default selection.

#### Temperature

* Uses a **Temperature Set Point** value input via the Web UI or API as the Set Point for calculating output. If the CheapoDC is being used without internet access then this mode allows a Set Point to be defined when a the DeW Point cannot be determined through the OpenWeather API.

#### Midpoint

* Uses the midpoint between the current **Temperature Mode** temperature value and the Dew Point value as the Set Point for calculating output. The impact of selecting this mode is to effectively double the Tracking Range and further flatten the ramp of the Power Output curve.

### Temperature Mode

The Temperature Mode selects how the Reference Temperature will be determined for calculating the Power Output.

#### Weather Query

* Uses the Ambient Temperature returned by the OpenWeather API weather query as the Reference Temperature for calculating the controller output. This requires that the CheapoDC have internet access.

#### External Input

* Use the **External Input** temperature set through the Web UI or API as the reference temperature for calculating the controller output. This may be the preferred mode when using the controller with KStars/Indi. The CheapoDC Indilib driver can use a temperature probe attached to a focuser as the external input. This is also the mode that should be used when the CheapoDC does not have access to the internat and the OpenWeather API.

## Hardware

One of the goals with the CheapoDC is for it to be relatively easy to assemble. Although some soldering will be
required the number of connections is minimized by using common modules. This section focuses on what is required
to build a basic two dew strap controller commonly needed for a primary telescope and secondary guide scope.

If you need additional dew controller outputs or the ability remotely control the power to another device then that
information is covered [here]().

### Component list

* ESP32-C3 SuperMini (Other ESP32 modules should work but this one is very small and low priced) Example: [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005967641936.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.10.3b2c1802dRy3Tw]
* Buck converter to reduce 12V to 5V. I used an [LM2596 Module](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08Q2YKJ6Q?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). You could also use an [MP1584EN Module](https://www.amazon.ca/eBoot-MP1584EN-Converter-Adjustable-Module/dp/B01MQGMOKI/ref=pd_sbs_d_sccl_2_3/141-9725081-7037101?pd_rd_w=UMd8F&content-id=amzn1.sym.ca022dba-8a59-468d-95a1-3216f611a75e&pf_rd_p=ca022dba-8a59-468d-95a1-3216f611a75e&pf_rd_r=4WWMQ6QG50JQ2BTYP273&pd_rd_wg=OCFjo&pd_rd_r=381f4abb-88a8-4856-a51f-39d3190099fa&pd_rd_i=B01MQGMOKI&th=1). These modules often have an adjustable output. You'll need to use an Volt meter to adjust the output to 5 volts before hooking it up.
* Two [dual-MOSFET Modules](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08ZNDG6RY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to handle output to the dew straps while being able to be triggered by the 3.3V levels from the ESP32 PWM pins.
* A resettable fuse that can handle 5A. An example [5A PPTC](https://www.amazon.ca/10pcs-5000MA-Resettable-RGEF500-GF500/dp/B092T9Q3QR/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3KNZXWN5ZIERR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.y5Pp17w_i-KzaprejYOYzM_8u_S5MY_jz1z932C2gBBmx5zcGFKHMHtP6qYXScM_-6ii9W8lDuEq5tbkCUQdYOFESDzjnASBHIusx7zAFOkhc6SNPrOH4O8ExB9WzAI-XgtIUvz-EvjfyOzjX4IN8iGl2GSffYGCb1BvIzldhIbrwCyyvNRyEfUCehiFknfJ5Uz1PSdPnC0BJjzSZp7Frh_EDLOF4CjpyeUQckj0FTQ347ehfh3jy3kHSu3I2iTOEaQZMRdqjpkW_NBOUMMsZsbeRdkMtzq0cIrGcsbUdhk.8jKyynsByh2dYlS0gLu9IdNbxiIm4iDIQv6g0ucFzCc&dib_tag=se&keywords=5a+pptc&qid=1709138849&sprefix=5a+pptc%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-4)
* Optionally an LED and resistor for the status LED. Many astrophotograpers do not want power LEDs or lights of any sort on their equipment. If you fall into this category then just use the ESP32 onboard LED as the status LED. If you would prefer a visible status LED on your project case then you may optionally add one. Status LED details may be found in the [Status LED Section](#cheapodc-status-led).  
In my implementation I used a red LED connected to the same pin as the onboard LED, pin 8. I used a 1K resistor to keep the LED fairly dim while still working.
* Some assorted hardware:
  * 12VDC 5.5mm x 2.1mm socket. Common socket size used for Astronomy.
  * Switch that will work for 12VDC at 5A.
  * Two RCA sockets. RCA plugs are commonly used for dew straps.

### Basic Wiring Diagram

![Wiring Diagram](images/wiring.jpg)

The default configuration for the basic dual output controller uses Controller Outputs, 0 and 1, mapped to GPIO pins 0 and 1.
If you cannot use these GPIO pins then they may be changed using the Web UI on the [Device Management](#cheapodc-device-management)
page or the default values may be changed in the [CDCDefines.h](CheapoDC/README.md#configure-firmware-in-the-cdcdefinesh-file) file
before building the firmware.

### Working Implementation

Assembled in a 6 inch long piece of 2"x1" aluminum channel. This also has Pin 8, which is the status LED, connected to an extra LED on the left side for external visibility. The ESP32-C3 is also mounted in some protoboard to make the wiring easier. If you plan to use a small case like this, use silicone hookup wire. The extra flexibility of silicone wire will save a lot of frustration. I used 22 awg wire for the 5V and 3.3V ESP32 connections and 18 awg wire for the 12V connections.

## Firmware

How to build the CheapoDC firmware can be found [here](/CheapoDC/README.md).

## Weather Service

The current temperature and humidity for your location may be obtained by either using one of the two CheapoDC integrated open weather service APIs or may be be provided from an external client through the CheapoDC API. Dew point is calculated based on the temperature and humidity values. The Weather Source may be set using the [Web UI](#cheapodc-controller-configuration) or through the [API](#cheapodc-api). CheapoDC defaults to using Open-Meteo.

### [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)

Open-Meteo is the default service configured for CheapoDC. Use of the Open-Meteo API does not require any registration for current weather queries. The free level allows for 10,000 API calls per day. Weather updates seem to be regular at a 15 minute interval. While using a 5 minute query interval, several CheapoDCs can be running at the same time without issue.

### [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)

 In order to use the OpenWeather API a registered account and API key is required. The account is free and allows for up to 60 queries/minute and 1,000,000 per month. Weather updates can occur from 5 to 20 minutes apart. Doing an API call every 5 minutes is more than adequate for dew control and even with 2 or 3 CheapoDC's sharing a key should have no issue at the free account level. Register and get your API key [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

### External Source

 When the Weather Source is set to External Source the temperature and humidity values for your location must be set via the CheapoDC API. This allows for integration with other weather services or personal weather stations.

### Which Weather Service to use?

Both services require a location using Latitude and Longitude which you can set using the CheapoDC [Web UI](/README.md#web-ui) or [CHeapoDC API](#cheapodc-api). Both sources will use weather stations close to the provided coordinates. OpenWeather provides the name of the weather station used in its response. Open-Meteo does not. If run side-by-side with the same co-ordinates they provide slightly different results. You may want to check which service provides the best results for your location.

As indicated the default service is Open-Meteo. This is primarily because no registration is required to use the open service.

## Web UI

CheapoDC comes with a Web UI that supports basic web authentication. The ID and password for the web authentication is set in the CDCdefines.h file as part of the build configuration. Default is "admin" for both. TLS (or HTTPS) is not supported so the security is minimal. The intention is to provide a deterrent to someone on your network from easily doing a Web OTA upgrade to the firmware or uploading files to the LittleFS partition.

The Web UI has 4 main pages, a dashboard, a configuration page, a device management page and a file management page.

### CheapoDC Dashboard

![CheapoDC Dashboard](images/dashboard.jpg)  

The Dashboard provides a summary of the current location, weather, controller output and settings. Internet connectivity is required for current weather information and the weather icon.

### CheapoDC Controller Configuration

![CheapoDC Configuration](images/configuration.jpg)  

CheapoDC Configuration page is where dew controller parameters may be set. These include the [Controller Mode](#controller-mode), [Temperature Mode](#temperature-mode), [Set Point Mode](#set-point-mode) and [variables](#variables) that affect dew controller output.

The Location and Time Zone may also be set here.

### CheapoDC Device Management

![CheapoDC Device Management](images/devicemgmt.jpg)  

The Device Management page is where device level configuration is done for the CheapoDC. This includes:

#### Controller Output Configuration

Used to configure GPIO Pin mappings for outputs as well as setting the Output Mode for each output. The CheapoDC can support up to 6 Controller Output Pins, Pin 0 through Pin 5. Pins 0 and 1 may only be used as dew controller outputs while Pins 2 through 5 may be set to any of the supported Output Modes:

##### Output Modes

|Output Mode|Description|Supported Output Pins|
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
|Disabled|Output is disabled. The default. GPIO pin mapping set to -1.|Pin 0 through Pin 5|
|Controller|Output is controlled by the dew controller.|Pin 0 through Pin 5|
|PWM|Output is manually controlled using PWM and output may be set from 0% to 100%.|Pin 2 through Pin 5|
|Boolean|Output is manually controlled and may be either Off (0%) or On (100%).|Pin 2 through Pin 5|

Note that a Controller Output Pin to GPIO Pin mapping must be set before an Output Mode may be selected. These settings may be controlled via the Web UI or the API.

#### WiFi Configuration

Shows current network information and allows you to configure the hostname and WiFi access point to use for network access. CheapoDC can be configured to step through multiple access points to make a WiFi connection.
* Network Information
  * Wifi Mode: STA = Station Mode, AP = Access Point Mode.
  * Hostname: Current active hostname. If updated a reboot is required to see the new hostname.
  * IP Address.
* Configure WiFi
  * Name: Allows you to pick an access point for editting the password. Or, select `Add WiFi` to add an access point.
  * SSID: Is the access point SSID point to add or edit. To delete an access point blank out the SSID and click **Update**.
  * Password: Is the password for the access point. **Show Password** will only work for adding a new WiFi access point.

Changes to any of the WiFi Configuration setting require a reboot to take effect.

#### Change Password

Changing the default password of ***admin*** to your own password is recommended.

#### Status LED Configuration

Used to change the Status LED pin mapping from the default of GPIO 8. Also used to set the active High Value to ***1*** or ***0***.

#### Firmware Update

CheapoDC supports two methods for updating firmware. 

1. Web OTA Update: Will indicate when a new release is available and then allow for an HTTP based OTA update. This will update both the firmware and data partitions while preserving your configuration settings. No software or Arduino IDE knowledge is required for this update method. Please consult the [Web OTA Update FAQ](https://hcomet.github.io/CheapoDC/CheapoDCWebUpdate.html) for details.
2. Manual OTA Update: Allows for an OTA update to firmware that has been compiled and built on your own machine. This only updates the data partition. You will need to manually update the files in the data partition using the [File Management UI](#cheapodc-file-management). At least Arduino IDE knowledge is required for this method.

#### Reboot Device

To remotely reboot the CheapoDC.

### CheapoDC File Management

![CheapoDC Device Management](images/filemgmt.jpg)  

The CheapoDC uses LittleFS for file storage on the ESP32. Although LittleFS supports directories as well as files CheapoDC uses a flat structure and all files are managed at the root. The file management page supports upload, download and delete functions.

## CheapoDC Status LED

The Status LED is used to provide information about the current status of the CheapoDC. Status blinking lasts for 10 seconds. It will blink as WiFi access attempts are made. If a Station mode connection is successfully made to an access point then the status LED will slow blink (1 second cycle). If no connection is made then the CheapoDC will go into Access Point mode. The status LED will then fast blink (200ms cycle).

The status LED will also blink for 10 seconds after the controller changes the power output and after an API or Web UI driven controller configuration change.

If the status LED is not turning off after connecting to WiFI or after the 10 second blink then you may need to reverse the High value setting. This can also be done in the Web UI by changing the High Value setting in [Status LED Configuration](#status-led-configuration).

## CheapoDC API

The CheapoDC provides API access to all configuration and data items available through the [Web UI](/README.md#web-ui). There is no authentication support in the API but the API also does not support firmware OTA updates or file management. These can only be done through the Web UI.

CheapoDC supports two API mechanisms:

1. TCP API using JSON syntax
2. Basic Web API utilizing HTTP POST

Formerly a third mechanism, Web Sockets API, was supported but wav deprecated in release v2.2.0.

The APIs use the same commands which are listed in the top of [CDCommands.cpp](/CheapoDC/CDCommands.cpp). Commands are 2 to 4 character strings. For each command there is a map indicating:

* the number of the command,
* whether or not the value associated with the command is to be saved or loaded using the CDCConfig.json file,
* units used for the value. Units are HTML or JSON formatted and may be:
  * None: empty string.
  * Degrees Celsius: "\&deg;C"
  * Decimal Degrees: "\&deg;"
  * Percent: "\&percnt;"
  * Milliseconds: "msec"
  * Seconds: "sec"
  * Minutes: "min"
  * JSON ENUM, for enumerated values like Controller Mode.
    * ie: "{"Mode":["Automatic","Manual","Off"]}"

The table below provides a list of the commands but the code is the final correct source of truth here.

* String maximum lengths are identified in the table.
* Floats are truncated to 2 decimal places.
* All commands except **QN** and **PWDH** support getter API methods.
* For security reasons, **PWDH** does not allow a getter API but it also restricts the setter to the Web API and HTTP POST method. It also requires that the current Password digest hash be submitted as a second parameter.
* The **QN** command is a setter only command. It requires a value that is not Null. "NA" works.
* Commands supporting a **Setter** method are identified.
* The **ATPQ** and **HU** commands are only setter commands when Weather Source is set to External Source.
* Date and time responses are in local time based on the Time Zone Offset and DST Offset values.
* Controller Output commands: CPP#, CPM# and CPO# are independent API commands where the # must be one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
* Controller Output command CPP# allows a Controller Output to be mapped to -1 for Disabled or GPIO 0 through 39. Which actual GPIO pin to choose is ESP32 module dependent.
* Using an invalid command or trying a setter on a command not supporting a setter will return an error.
* Strictly speaking command values are always treated as Strings since the values are always enclosed in quotes in the JSON. Conversion to appropriate type is handled internally.
* The **CLC** command has been deprecated.

### TCP API

The TCP API uses JSON formatted commands over TCP on port 58000. JSON strings must always be terminated with a newline character "\n". "cmd" in the following formats is the 2 to 4 character command identified in [CDCommands.cpp](/CheapoDC/CDCommands.cpp).

#### Setter format

* Send: **{"SET":{"cmd":"value"}}**
* Response: **{"RESULT": result}**  

#### Getter format

* Send: **{\"GET\":"cmd"}**
* Response: **{"cmd":"value"}** - *if successful*
* Response: **{"RESULT": result}** - *if failure*

***NOTE:*** Where a response of **{"RESULT": result}** is received ***result*** may be one of:  

|   result  |  Reason                                            |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------|  
|0|for success |
|-1|for a command execution error|
|-2| for an unknown command or API parsing error|

### Web API

The Web API uses POST and "x-www-form-urlencoded" with name value pairs.

#### Setter Format

* Send: **cmd=value**  
* Response: HTTP status code of 200 on success.

#### Getter Format

* Send: **get=cmd**  
* Response: **cmd=value**  
success has HTTP status code of 200.

### Web Sockets API

Deprecated in release v2.2.0.
