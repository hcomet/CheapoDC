<h2><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Installation</h2>
<p>INDI CheapoDC driver is included with libindi 2.0.7+.</p>
</p>To Install the driver under Ubuntu:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mutlaqja/ppa
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install libindi1
</pre>
<h2><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Features</h2>
<p>The Cheapo Dew Controller, or CheapoDC, is a low cost, low component count, easy to build DIY dew controller based on
	an ESP32-C3 mini.
	Parts required include the ESP32-C3 mini, one or two MOSFET modules, a 12V to 5V buck converter, some protoboard,
	a couple of RCA sockets, a 12V barrel socket and wire. Cost of the parts should be less than $20 for a unit that
	controls 2 dew heater straps. Details for build and operation of CheapoDC can be found on the
	<a href="https://github.com/hcomet/CheapoDC">project site</a>.
</p>
<p>Current features include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automated tracking using either <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> or
		<a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Open-Meteo</a> to retrieve ambient temperature, humidity and dew point.
	</li>
	<li>Designed to work with Indilib with the ability to leverage geographic coordinates from your mount and
		temperature from your focuser temperature probe.</li>
	<li>Controller modes supporting both Automated and Manual operation.</li>
	<li>Flexible tracking modes supporting multiple methods to calculate output power to the two output channels.</li>
	<li>Can operate in WiFi Access Point mode in either a semi-Automated or Manual mode if no network or Internet
		connectivity is available. But the CheapoDC does work best with internet connectivity, </li>
</ul>
<p>A primary goal was to keep the build simple with minimal parts. This is done by leveraging the ESP32 WiFi capability
	to query one of the
	open weather service APIs. API queries are used for ambient temperature, humidity and dew point. This is then used
	for calculating CheapoDC's power output.
	No additional integrated components, such as temperature or humidity probes, are required. Many astrophotographers already have
	temperature probes for their electronic focuser and these may be
	leveraged through the INDI driver. The responsiveness and aggressiveness of the controller can be adjusted through
	the CheapoDC configuration settings. All temperature values reported in the driver interface are in degrees celsius.</p>
<p>When running the driver for the first time, the default Server Address, <b>cheapodc.local</b>, should work. If not,
	go to the <b>Connection</b> tab to change the Server Address.
	Enter your CheapoDC IP address or modified hostname then retry the connection using the Connect button on the <strong>Main Control</strong> tab. 
	After connecting succesfully go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab and
	save the settings.</p>
<h2><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Controller Power Output Calculation</h2>
<p>Controller output is calculated by determining the position of a reference temperature withing a tracking range. This is outlined below.</p>
<H3>Output Calculation Variables:</H3>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li><b>Set Point</b> = <b><em>SP</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>a temperature point set using the <b>Set Point Mode</b> selection.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Reference Temperature</b> = <b><em>RT</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>as set using the <b>Temperature Mode</b> selection.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Track Point</b> = <b><em>TP</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the calculated temperature point where the <b>Tracking Range</b> starts. A <b>Reference Temperature</b> less than or
			equal
			to the <b>Track Point</b> will cause the controller to use <b>Maximum Output</b>. </li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Track Point Offset</b> = <b><em>TPO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>a temperature offset applied to the <b>Set Point</b> when calcualting the <b>Track Point</b> relative to the <b>Set
				Point</b>. The <b>Track Point Offset</b> may be set from -5.0&deg;C to 5.0&deg;C. The default is 0.0&deg;C.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Tracking Range</b> = <b><em>TR</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the temperature range, with the lower end starting at the <b>Track Point</b>. The controller output ramps up from <b>Minimum
				Output</b> at the high end of the range to <b>Maximum Output</b> at the low end of the range. The range may be set to
			values from 4.0&deg;C to 10.0&deg;C. The default is 4.0&deg;C.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Power Output</b> = <b><em>PO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the percentage of power the controller is outputting to the dew straps. It varies from the <b>Minimum
				Output</b> setting to the <b>Maximum Output</b> setting.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Minimum Output</b> = <b><em>MinO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the minimum percent power setting for the controller to output when not in the <b>Off</b><b>Controller
				Mode</b>. Defaults to 0&percnt;.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Maximum Output</b> = <b><em>MaxO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the maximum percent power setting for the controller to output when at full output. Defaults to 100&percnt;.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Output Calculation</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./calculation.jpg" alt="Calculations" />
<h3>Output Example</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./example.jpg" alt="Example" />
<p>The Power Output (PO) curve is shown relative to the Track Point (TP) and the Tracking Range (TR). While the
	Reference Temperature (RT)
	is greater than the high end of the Tracking Range the Power Output is set to Minimum Output (MinO). The Power
	Output ramps up linearly
	through the Tracking Range from the Minimum Output to the Maximum Output (MaxO) as
	the Reference Temperature drops.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This example shows a Reference Temperature, RT = 8°C, which is greater than the upper end of the Tracking Range,
		causing
		Power Output to be set to Minimum Output. In this case Minimum Output is set to 10%.</li>
	<li>The upper end of the Tracking Range, at 7°C, is determined from the Set Point (SP = -2°C) plus the Track Point
		Offset
		(TPO = 4°C), creating a Tack Point, TP = 2°C, plus the Tracking Range (TR = 5°C).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The Set Point and the Reference Temperature values may vary from one output calculation to the next with 
	each weather update.</p>
<h2><i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Operation</h2>
<h3>Connection</h3>
<p>Connection details are based on the configuration of the hostname set in the CheapoDC CDCWiFi.json file installed on
	the controller. Only TCP/IP
	network connections are supported.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./connection.jpg" alt="Connection" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Network</strong>: Use TCP with the
		default port number of 58000.
		CheapoDC uses mDNS with a default hostname of <b>cheapodc.local</b> which should allow for an automatic
		connection.
		If you changed CheapoDC hostname you will need to update the server address. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Under the Options tab, you can configure parameters to optimize the operation of the dew controller. </p>
