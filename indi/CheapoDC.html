<h2><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Installation</h2>
<p>INDI CheapoDC driver is included with libindi 2.0.7+.</p>
</p>To Install the driver under Ubuntu:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mutlaqja/ppa
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install libindi1
</pre>
<h2><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Features</h2>
<p>The Cheapo Dew Controller, or CheapoDC, is a low cost, low component count, easy to build DIY dew controller based on
	an ESP32-C3 mini.
	Parts required include the ESP32-C3 mini, one or two MOSFET modules, a 12V to 5V buck converter, some protoboard,
	a couple of RCA sockets, a 12V barrel socket and wire. Cost of the parts should be less than $20 for a unit that
	controls 2 dew heater straps. Details for build and operation of CheapoDC can be found on the
	<a href="https://github.com/hcomet/CheapoDC">project site</a>.
</p>
<p>Current features include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automated tracking using either <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> or
		<a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Open-Meteo</a> to retrieve ambient temperature, humidity and dew point.
	</li>
	<li>Designed to work with Indilib with the ability to leverage geographic coordinates from your mount, 
		temperature/humidity from a weather device and temperature from your focuser temperature probe.</li>
	<li>Controller modes supporting both Automated and Manual operation.</li>
	<li>Flexible dew condition tracking modes supporting multiple methods to calculate output power to the two output channels.</li>
	<li>Can operate in WiFi Access Point mode in either a semi-Automated or Manual mode if no network or Internet
		connectivity is available. But the CheapoDC does work best with internet connectivity, </li>
</ul>
<p>A primary goal was to keep the build simple with minimal parts. This is done by leveraging the ESP32 WiFi capability
	to query one of the
	open weather service APIs. API queries are used for ambient temperature, humidity and dew point. This is then used
	for calculating CheapoDC's power output.
	No additional integrated components, such as temperature or humidity probes, are required. Many astrophotographers already have
	temperature probes for their electronic focuser and these may be
	leveraged through the INDI driver. The responsiveness and aggressiveness of the controller can be adjusted through
	the CheapoDC configuration settings. All temperature values reported in the driver interface are in degrees celsius.</p>
<p>When running the driver for the first time, the default Server Address, <b>cheapodc.local</b>, should work. If not,
	go to the <b>Connection</b> tab to change the Server Address.
	Enter your CheapoDC IP address or modified hostname then retry the connection using the Connect button on the <strong>Main Control</strong> tab. 
	After connecting succesfully go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab and
	save the settings.</p>
<h2><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Controller Power Output Calculation</h2>
<p>Controller output is calculated by determining the position of a reference temperature withing a tracking range. This is outlined below.</p>
<H3>Output Calculation Variables:</H3>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li><b>Set Point</b> = <b><em>SP</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>a temperature point set using the <b>Set Point Mode</b> selection.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Reference Temperature</b> = <b><em>RT</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>as set using the <b>Temperature Mode</b> selection.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Track Point</b> = <b><em>TP</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the calculated temperature point where the <b>Tracking Range</b> starts. A <b>Reference Temperature</b> less than or
			equal
			to the <b>Track Point</b> will cause the controller to use <b>Maximum Output</b>. </li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Track Point Offset</b> = <b><em>TPO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>a temperature offset applied to the <b>Set Point</b> when calcualting the <b>Track Point</b> relative to the <b>Set
				Point</b>. The <b>Track Point Offset</b> may be set from -5.0&deg;C to 5.0&deg;C. The default is 0.0&deg;C.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Tracking Range</b> = <b><em>TR</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the temperature range, with the lower end starting at the <b>Track Point</b>. The controller output ramps up from <b>Minimum
				Output</b> at the high end of the range to <b>Maximum Output</b> at the low end of the range. The range may be set to
			values from 4.0&deg;C to 10.0&deg;C. The default is 4.0&deg;C.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Power Output</b> = <b><em>PO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the percentage of power the controller is outputting to the dew straps. It varies from the <b>Minimum
				Output</b> setting to the <b>Maximum Output</b> setting.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Minimum Output</b> = <b><em>MinO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the minimum percent power setting for the controller to output when not in the <b>Off</b><b>Controller
				Mode</b>. Defaults to 0&percnt;.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Maximum Output</b> = <b><em>MaxO</em></b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>the maximum percent power setting for the controller to output when at full output. Defaults to 100&percnt;.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Output Calculation</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./calculation.jpg" alt="Calculations" />
<h3>Output Example</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./example.jpg" alt="Example" />
<p>The Power Output (PO) curve is shown relative to the Track Point (TP) and the Tracking Range (TR). While the
	Reference Temperature (RT)
	is greater than the high end of the Tracking Range the Power Output is set to Minimum Output (MinO). The Power
	Output ramps up linearly
	through the Tracking Range from the Minimum Output to the Maximum Output (MaxO) as
	the Reference Temperature drops.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This example shows a Reference Temperature, RT = 8°C, which is greater than the upper end of the Tracking Range,
		causing
		Power Output to be set to Minimum Output. In this case Minimum Output is set to 10%.</li>
	<li>The upper end of the Tracking Range, at 7°C, is determined from the Set Point (SP = -2°C) plus the Track Point
		Offset
		(TPO = 4°C), creating a Tack Point, TP = 2°C, plus the Tracking Range (TR = 5°C).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The Set Point and the Reference Temperature values may vary from one output calculation to the next with 
	each weather update.</p>
<h2><i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Operation</h2>
<h3>Connection</h3>
<p>Connection details are based on the configuration of the hostname set in the CheapoDC CDCWiFi.json file installed on
	the controller. Only TCP/IP
	network connections are supported.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./connection.jpg" alt="Connection" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Network</strong>: Use TCP with the
		default port number of 58000.
		CheapoDC uses mDNS with a default hostname of <b>cheapodc.local</b> which should allow for an automatic
		connection.
		If you changed CheapoDC hostname you will need to update the server address. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Under the Options tab, you can configure parameters to optimize the operation of the dew controller. </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./options.jpg" alt="Options" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Not currently supported.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Load/Save/set to Default/Purge the configuration for connection setup as well
		as Snoop Location and Snoop Temperature settings. CheapoDC controller settings are automatically saved in the
		controller. </li>
	<li><strong>Polling</strong>: Polling defines the period in milliseconds that the driver uses to retrieve data from
		the dew controller. The default is 30,000 milliseconds
		or 30 seconds. This is the recommended polling period with an Update Output period of 1 minute.</li>
	<li><strong>Output Min</strong>: Minimum &percnt; power level to output to both channels. 0 to (Output Maximum - 1)
		(Default 0).</li>
	<li><strong>Output Max</strong>: Maximum &percnt; power level to output to both channels. (Output Minimum + 1) to 100
		(Default 100).</li>
	<li><strong>Track Point Offset</strong>: Number of degrees celsius to adjust the Track Point. -5.0 to 5.0 (Default
		0.0).</li>
	<li><strong>Tracking Range</strong>: Number of degrees celsius over which the Output Power will ramp when the Reference
		Temperature is in this range. 4.0 to 10.0 (Default 5.0).</li>
	<li><strong>Update Output</strong>: Period for recalculation of the Output Power in minutes. 1 to 20 (Default
		1).</li>
	<li><strong>Query Weather</strong>: Period for weather service API queries in minutes. 1 to 20 (Default 5).</li>
	<li><strong>Weather Source</strong>:</li> The source used for getting the local weather temperature and humidity
	which are used by the CheapoDC device to calculate the dew point and output power. The weather source may be:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong>: The CheapoDC will query the Open-Meteo service every Query Weather seconds for weather 
		updates. Open-Meteo is the default.</li>
		<li><strong>OpenWeather</strong>: The CheapoDC will query the OpenWeather service every Query Weather seconds for weather 
		updates. An API Key is required for weather services from OpenWeather.</li>
		<li><strong>External Source</strong>: The CheapoDC will NOT query a weather service but will use temperature and humidity
			values pushed to it via it's API. A Weather Device must be set in the Snoop Devices section for 
		this setting to work properly. The weather update period is defined by the weather device and should be settable in the 
		weather device's configuration tabs.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Weather API Key</strong>: An API key is required to use <a
			href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> which can be acquired after registering for a free 
			OpenWeather account. If <a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Open-Meteo</a> is used then no API key is 
			required. This option field will only be displayed when the Weather Source is set to OpenWeather.
		</li>
	<li><strong>Weather Last Updated</strong>: The date and time of the last weather report update. For Open-Meteo and OpenWeather 
		the update time is taken from service API response. For External Source the update time is set every time a weather device
		value is pushed to the CheapoDC. The time is reported using local time based on the UTC Offset shown in the Site Management tab.</li>
	<li><strong>Snoop Devices</strong>:Set the appropriate active device to be snooped for CheapoDC configuration and updates. Snoop for any 
		of the devices can be disabled by setting the device to blank.
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Telescope</strong>: The telescope driver used to configure GEOGRAPHIC_COORD for LAT and LONG values shown on the 
			Site Management tab. The UTC Offset is also set from the telescope driver. It is important to configure this correctly so 
			that CheapoDC weather queries are made for the correct geolocation. Default device is Telescope Simulator.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Focuser</strong>: May be set to a focuser driver if the focuser has a temperature probe. When sent the probe temperature
			will be sent to the CheapoDC and be shown on the Main Control tab in the Temperature - External Input field. If the CheapoDC 
			Temperature Mode is set to External Input then the External Input temperature will be used as the Reference Temperature for 
			calculating output power. Default device is Focuser Simulator.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Weather</strong>: May be set to a weather driver if if there is an indilib weather device such as a personal weather station 
			co-located with your observation location. When set, the temperature and  humidity reported by the weather device will be used to update
			CheapoDC's weather query temperature and humidity values for calculating dew point and power output. 
			The CheapoDC Weather Source must be set to External Source for these values to be pushed to the CheapoDC device and be used
			for calculating output power. Default device is Weather Simulator.
		</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After setting up the device Options, save the configuration using the Configuration - Save button.</p>
<h3>Site Management</h3>
<p>The site management tab may be used to configure the device location used by CheapoDC when making weather queries. By
	default the CheapoDC driver is configured to get location geographic coordinates from another device such as a 
	telescope or mount. This the preferred configuration.</p>
	<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./sitemanagement.jpg" alt="Site Management" /></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location</strong>:
		<ul><li><strong>Lat (dd:mm:ss)</strong>: The Latitude in degrees, minutes and seconds. Values: -90:00:00 to 90:00:00.</li>
		<li><strong>Lon (dd:mm:ss)</strong>: The Longitude in degrees, minutes and seconds. Values: 00:00:00 to 360:00:00.</li></ul>
		<li><strong>Device Time</strong>: The local time on the CheapoDC device based on the devices NTP server configuration (set using
			the devices Wed UI) and the UTC offset.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Local Time</strong>: Local date and time based on UTC offset.
					Info - Name. (Default Telescope Simulator).</li>
				<li><strong>UTC Offset</strong>: The offset from UTC time in hours. Should be set from the Telescope device. If no telescope device
				is set then it will be pulled from the CheapoDC device settings.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Main Control</h3>
<p>The main control tab is where the different CheapoDC operating modes may be set and current controller power output
	may be monitored.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./maincontrol.jpg" alt="Main Control" />
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Connection</strong>: Shows current connection state as well as the ability to <strong>Connect</strong>
		or <strong>Disconnect</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Controller Mode</strong>: Sets the primary operating mode for the dew controller:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Automatic</strong>: In this mode the controller will automatically calculate and update the
				output power based
				on the Output Update period set in the Options tab. (Default)</li>
			<li><strong>Manual</strong>: In this mode a user may manually set the output level with the OutPut Power
				setting. The Output Power setting is writable only when the controller is in this mode.</li>
			<li><Strong>Off</Strong>: The controller is off and output power is zero. Weather queries will continue and
				update the weather values. If the CheapoDC comes up in WiFi AP mode then it will default to <strong>Off</strong>
				until changed by the user.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Output Power</strong>: Displays the current controller output power as a percentage from 0 to 100. May
